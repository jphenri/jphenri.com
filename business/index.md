## What is Business 2.0?

Business 2.0 is my way of describing a small business that:

- Uses AI and automation intelligently (not just hype)
- Has clean, simple processes instead of chaos
- Owns its data and uses it to make decisions
- Keeps the human, local touch at the center

I mix three worlds:

1. **Enterprise IT & security** – endpoint management, patching, compliance  
2. **SMB reality** – limited budget, real constraints, need for ROI  
3. **AI tools** – language models, automation, content, analytics

## How I can help

- Map your current tools and workflows
- Identify **3–5 quick wins** with AI / automation
- Help you create **repeatable workflows** you can maintain
- Connect this with your **web, SEO and content** (like Chez Gerry 1958)
