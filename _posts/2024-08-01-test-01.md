# How I Built JPHENRI.COM Using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and ChatGPT

Welcome to JPHENRI.COM! I’m excited to share the story of how I created this website using **GitHub**, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and the Minima theme, with a little help from ChatGPT. If you’re interested in setting up your own site or want to learn more about these tools, this blog post will walk you through the process step by step.

## Getting Started with GitHub Pages

**GitHub Pages** is a free service provided by GitHub that lets you host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It’s perfect for personal projects, portfolios, or even blogs like this one. Here’s how I got started:

### Step 1: Creating the Repository on GitHub

The first step was to create a new repository on GitHub named `jphenri.github.io`. This naming convention is key because GitHub Pages automatically recognizes it as a personal website. After setting up the repository, I chose the `main` branch as the default.

### Step 2: Enabling GitHub Pages

Next, I went to the repository settings and enabled GitHub Pages. I selected the `main` branch as the source, and just like that, my website was live on the internet. GitHub also offers a selection of pre-built themes, but I opted for more customization using Jekyll.

## Using Jekyll for a Dynamic Website

Jekyll is a static site generator that’s perfect for creating blogs or project showcases. It works by converting Markdown files into a complete website.

### Jekyll Folder Structure

When you create a new Jekyll site, it comes with a standard folder structure. Understanding this structure is key to customizing your site.

- **_config.yml**: This is the main configuration file where you set up your site’s details, theme, plugins, and other configurations.
- **_posts/**: This folder contains all your blog posts. Each post is a Markdown file named with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- **_layouts/**: Layouts are templates used to wrap your content. For example, a single post might use the `post.html` layout.
- **_includes/**: This folder contains smaller chunks of HTML that can be included in other layouts or pages using the `{% include %}` tag.
- **_sass/**: This folder contains your Sass (CSS preprocessor) files. You can organize your styles here, and Jekyll will compile them into regular CSS.
- **_site/**: This folder is generated by Jekyll and contains the final output of your site. It’s what gets served to visitors.
- **assets/**: This folder holds your site’s assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **index.md**: This is your site’s homepage. You can edit this Markdown file to customize the content of your home page.

### Configuring _config.yml

The _config.yml file is where you control most of your site’s settings. Here’s a basic configuration setup I used for JPHENRI.COM:

```yaml
title: "JPHENRI.COM"
description: "Showcasing my IT projects and blog."
baseurl: "" # Leave blank for the root of the domain
url: "https://jphenri.github.io" # Your GitHub Pages URL

theme: minima
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-seo-tag

# Exclude these files from the site
exclude:
  - README.md
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock

# Social media links
social_links:
  email: "mailto:your-email@example.com"
  github: "https://github.com/your-username"
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile"
```
