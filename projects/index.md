## What this page is

This is a **living portfolio** of the things I build, test and break:

- small business experiments (Business 2.0),
- IT / home lab setups,
- AI-powered workflows,
- content & web projects.

## 🧠 Business 2.0 & small business

### Chez Gerry 1958 – “cobbler lab”
URL: https://chezgerry1958.com  

**Type:** Small business transformation · Local business  
**Status:** Ongoing  

A long-term Business 2.0 project where everything is real: customers, repairs, workflows, storytelling and content.

### Chuck’s Casse-Croûte – micro-restaurant website
URL: https://chucks-casse-croute.com  

**Type:** Lightweight GitHub Pages site · Branding & Identity  
**Status:** Completed (v1)  

A simple GitHub Pages website created to:

- give Chuck’s Casse-Croûte a clean digital identity,  
- host basic information and menu sections,  
- provide a URL that is brandable and easy to share,  
- serve as a base for future features if needed.

It’s intentionally minimal — fast, lightweight, mobile-friendly —  
and reflects how a small site can still look professional **without a CMS**.
