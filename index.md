  <h2>Business 2.0</h2>
  <p class="section-lead">
    Business 2.0 is my practical framework for using technology in a realistic, simple and sustainable way
    for small businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most small businesses don’t need a dozen new tools — they need <strong>clarity</strong>, less manual work
    and better visibility on what really matters. My work starts from what already exists in the shop,
    the inbox, the spreadsheets and the conversations with clients, then adds just enough structure,
    automation and AI to make a difference.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Understand the reality</strong>: how work actually flows today (not how it “should” work).</li>
    <li><strong>Simplify first</strong>: remove friction and noise before adding new systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Add targeted automation</strong>: only where it saves real time or reduces risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Use AI as an assistant</strong>: to help with content, documentation and decision-making, not to replace people.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure the impact</strong>: time saved, fewer errors, better customer experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Everything I test in my lab eventually ends up applied in real projects with real businesses —
    like the ones below.

    If you have a project or idea and you’re not sure where to start, we can begin with a simple conversation.

    I’m especially interested in small businesses, local projects and teams who want to modernize
    without losing their identity. Whether it’s a website, a workflow, documentation or an AI use case,
    the first step is understanding your reality.

    You don’t need a full brief. A few lines about who you are, what you do and what’s blocking you
    is more than enough to start.
